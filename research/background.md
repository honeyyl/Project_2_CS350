#### Shortcomings of the (Current Version of the) System:

- Performance on Large Datasets: Superset may struggle with responsiveness when dealing with very large datasets or high user concurrency, depending on the backend database and system resources.
- Dashboard rendering can be slow without optimization, especially with complex visualizations.
- Requires proper integration with databases and external services, which may necessitate additional expertise.
- Limited Support for Advanced Analytics: Superset is not designed for complex statistical modeling or machine learning. Users must rely on external tools for such tasks.
- Customization Challenges: While Superset is extensible, customizing it often requires deep knowledge of React, Flask, and Superset's internal architecture, which can be a learning curve for developers.

#### Plans for the Future of the System:

Enhanced User Experience:

Improved UI/UX for dashboard creation, making it more accessible for non-technical users.
Simplified workflow for common tasks like chart customization and report scheduling.
Real-Time Data and Streaming Support:

Native support for real-time data visualizations and integrations with streaming data sources like Apache Kafka.
Performance Improvements:

Focus on optimizing the system to handle larger datasets and higher concurrency levels more efficiently.
Enhanced caching mechanisms to reduce latency.
Machine Learning and AI Integration:

Plans to incorporate basic predictive analytics and ML visualization features to appeal to a broader audience.
Expanded Extensibility:

Additional APIs and plugin frameworks for easier customization and integration with third-party tools.
Community Engagement and Contributions:

Continued encouragement of contributions from the open-source community to enhance features, fix bugs, and provide diverse database support.
These advancements aim to solidify Supersetâ€™s position as a leading open-source BI and data visualization tool.
