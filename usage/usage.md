- Intuitive interface requires no prior coding knowledge.

### Semantic Layer
- Define custom dimensions and metrics for datasets to enhance analytical flexibility.

### SQL IDE
- Includes a powerful SQL editor for writing queries and preparing data.

### Adaptable Extensions
- Integrates with existing infrastructure.  
- Supports custom plugins and APIs for automation.

### Cloud-Native Architecture
Superset is scalable, featuring:
- **Distributed Task Management**  
- **Asynchronous Caching**

## Usage with SQLite Database

### Example: Use SQLite in Superset to Analyze Sales Data

1. **Create a SQLite Database:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 sales_data.db

2. **Create tables and add sample data to them:**
   ```bash 
   CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date TEXT,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    order_value REAL
    );

    CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    region TEXT
    );

    INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, '2024-01-01', 1, 150.00);
    INSERT INTO orders VALUES (2, '2024-01-02', 2, 200.00);
    INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'North');
    INSERT INTO customers VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 'South');

3. **Connect SQLite to Superset:**
   ```bash 
    - Connect to the SQLite database (sales_data.db) using the Superset interface.
    
    - Create visualizations, execute queries, and examine the tables.
